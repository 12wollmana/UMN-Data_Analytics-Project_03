                                            clustering algorithm to find the
                                            different classifications.

                                            To conduct the algorithm, we need to
                                            find the optimum number (k-value) of
                                            clusters we would like to identify.
                                            For this, we're going to use an
                                            Elbow Plot. For more information on

                                            plot when there is no longer a

                                            rounded than expected, but we felt
                                            comfortable with choosing a k-value
                                            of 3. 4 was also an option, but we
                                            felt there wouldn't be a significant
                                            difference between 3 and 4.

                                            identifying 3 clusters, we still
                                            need to clean up our data before we
                                            can run the clustering algorithm.

                                            One consideration we had to make was
                                            whether to scale our data or not so
                                            that all the values were consistent.
                                            The majority of our values were
                                            already between 0 and 1, but there
                                            were a few that weren't. We decided
                                            to run the clustering algorithm over
                                            both the scaled and non-scaled data
                                            to see which one performed better.

                                            In order to test whether the scaled
                                            or non-scaled model performed
                                            better, we calculated the
                                            shilhouette score for both models.

                                            The shilhouette score is ranged from
                                            -1 to 1, with a higher value being a
                                            better model. Our non-scaled model
                                            got a score of 0.508, while our
                                            scaled model recieved a 0.230.

                                            In the end, we decided to use the
                                            non-scaled data due to its higher
                                            score. The score also gave us more
                                            confidence in our clusters in
                                            general.

                                            Another consideration we had to make
                                            was whether to remove songs that
                                            charted multiple weeks in our data.
                                            For example <i>Despacito</i> by Luis
                                            Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring
                                            Justin Bieber was in our dataset 16
                                            times (Wow!). If we didn't remove
                                            the duplicates, this song's high
                                            tempo of 177 could have skewed the
                                            data more than we would have liked.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            We decided to only keep the rows in
                                            our data of a song's highest
                                            placement on the chart and drop the
                                            other rows. This meant that if a
                                            song crossed between years, then
                                            only the year that the song placed
                                            highest would be represented for
                                            that song.

                                            Now that we cleaned up our data and
                                            know that we have a k-value of 3
                                            clusters, it was now time to run the
                                            k-means algorithm.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            After running the algorithm, our
                                            data was split into 3 clusters,
                                            which we'll call Cluster 0, Cluster
                                            1, and Cluster 2. It was now our
                                            responsibility to try to identify
                                            what kind of music our clusters
                                            represented. Was one cluster rock
                                            music while another was dance?

                                            To try to figure this out, we
                                            decided to make a variety of graphs
                                            which looked at three different
                                            angles of the songs within the
                                            clusters:

                                                trended within the Billboard Top
